<h2>MR. PUNCH AND PAT</h2>

<p class="center">(<i>By way of Introduction</i>)</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 176px;">
<img src="images/i_005.jpg" width="176" height="300" alt="Ragged Irishman standing" />
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">No Punch</span> artist has done more
with Irish humour than Charles
Keene. Well over a third of the
<span class="smcap">Punch</span> drawings on this subject
are from his pencil. Most of the
<span class="smcap">Punch</span> artists have made good use
of it, Phil May and Mr. Raven-Hill
in particular.</p>

<p>Some of <span class="smcap">Mr. Punch's</span> jokes against
the Fenians, Home Rule, and Irish
disloyalty have a bitterness that is
quite unusual with him, but none of
these are included in our pages, and
he has at other times handled the
same topics with his customary
geniality and good-humoured satire.
He makes the most of the Irishman's traditional weakness for
"##bulls" whisky, fighting, and living with his pigs, but he gets
an immense amount of variety out of these themes, and does not
neglect to touch upon other typically Irish characteristics. If
you have examples of the Irishman's blunderings, you have
examples also of his ready wit and his amazing talent for
blarney.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span></p>

<p>We have thus in the present volume a delightful collection
of Irish wit and high spirits. The happy-go-lucky characteristic
of Pat is especially prominent in many of the jokes,
and interpreting <span class="smcap">Mr. Punch's</span> attitude towards the Irishman
as one of admiration for his many excellent qualities, instead
of regarding him as the "but" for English jokes, too often
the notion of comic writers, the editor has sought to represent
<span class="smcap">Mr. Punch</span> as the friend of Pat, sometimes his critic, but
always his good humoured well-wisher, who laughs at him
now and then, but as often with him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Irish Yolk.</span>&mdash;In
the name of the
profit&mdash;eggs! Irish co-operators
have already
made giant strides in
the production of milk
and butter, and now
the Irish Co-operative
Agency has decided, so
says the <i>Cork Daily
Herald</i>, to "take up
the egg trade." We hope the egg-traders won't be
"taken up," too; if so, the trade would be arrested
just when it was starting, and where would the
profit be then? "It is stated that many Irish eggs
now reach the English market dirty, stale, and
unsorted," so that wholesale English egg-merchants<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
have preferred to buy Austrian and French ones.
Ireland not able to compete with the foreigner!
Perish the thought! A little technical education
judiciously applied will soon teach the Irish fowl
not to lay "shop 'uns."</p>

<h2>ERIN GO BRAGH</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Punch</span>,&mdash;I perceive that there is a
movement on foot, initiated by the patriot Doogan,
M.P., for teaching the Irish language to the youthful
Redmonds and Healeys of the Emerald Isle.
I am sorry that the Government has not acquiesced
in the motion. I, myself, would bring in a measure
compelling all Hibernian Members of Parliament
to denounce (they never speak) in their native
tongue. Just fancy the rapture with which they
would inveigh in a language incapable of comprehension
by a single Sassenach! And what a
mighty relief to the other legislators! If necessary,
the Speaker might be provided with an Anglo-Irish
dictionary, or possibly a new post (open to
Nationalists only) might be created, viz., Interpreter
for Ireland.</p>

<p>Trusting that my suggestion may be supported
by you,</p>

<p class="center">
I am, yours obediently,</p>

<h2>IRISH PROVERBS</h2>


<p>Every goose thinks his wife a duck.</p>

<p>No news in a newspaper isn't good news.</p>

<p>Manners make the gentleman, and the want of
them drives him elsewhere for his shooting.</p>

<p>A miss is as good as a mile of old women.</p>

<p>Too many cooks spoil the broth of a boy.</p>

<p>It's foolish to spoil one's dinner for a ha'porth of
tarts.</p>

<p>There are as fine bulls in Ireland as ever came
out of it.</p>

<p>Necessity has no law, but an uncommon number
of lawyers.</p>

<p>Better to look like a great fool, than to be the
great fool you look.</p>

<p>A soft answer may turn away wrath, but in a
Chancery suit, a soft answer is only likely to turn
the scales against you.</p>

<p>One fortune is remarkably good until you have
had another one told you.</p>

<p>Don't halloa until you have got your head safe
out of the wood, particularly at Donnybrook Fair.</p>

<p>Men of straw don't make the best bricks.</p>

<p>It's a narrow bed that has no turning.</p>

<p>When money is sent flying out of the window
it's poverty that comes in at the door.</p>

<p>The pig that pleases to live must live to please.</p>

<p>One man may steal a hedge, whereas another
daren't even as much as look at a horse.</p>

<p>Short rents make long friends&mdash;and it holds good
equally with your landlord and your clothes.</p>

<p>The mug of a fool is known by there being nothing
in it.</p>

<p>You may put the carte before the horse, but you
can't make him eat.</p>

<p>Money makes the gentleman, the want of it the
blackguard.</p>

<p>When wise men fall out, then rogues come by
what is not their own.</p>

<p>1. The Speaker shall not speak except when he
is talking.</p>

<p>2. Such terms as "thief of the wurruld," "spalpeen,"
"nager," "villian," "polthroon," "thraytor,"
"omadhawn," &amp;c., and such epithets as "base,"
"brutal," "bloody-minded," and others named in
the schedule to these regulations, shall be considered
unparliamentary, except when used in the
heat of debate.</p>

<p>3. An Annual Budget shall be presented to the
House once a quarter.</p>

<p>4. Shilelaghs, revolvers, and pikes, shall not be
introduced into the House, except when accompanied
by a Member.</p>

<p>5. A Member shall be bound to attend every
debate. A Member, however, shall be excused if
he gets up in his place in the House and announces<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
that he would be present were he not ill at home
in bed.</p>

<p>6. A quorum shall consist of forty Members.
Should a count-out be demanded, Members who
have been engaged in personal altercation, shall
be included unless they are sufficiently conscious
to utter "Erin go Bragh!" thrice distinctly.</p>

<p>7. Duels will be strictly forbidden. Should any
Member, however, think proper to break this rule,
it will be considered a breach of privilege if he
does not invite the Speaker and the whole House
to see the fun.</p>

<p>8. There will be only one Speaker; but two or
more Members may be elected to the post.</p>

<p>9. Only one Member shall address the House at
a time, except when two or more wish to speak at
once, in which case they shall not interrupt each
other.</p>

<p>10. A Member when addressing the House shall
not wear his hat unless he has got it on his head
before rising, when he shall remove it on any
Member directing the Speaker's attention to the
fact.</p>

<p>11. Under no consideration whatever will the
consumption of any spirits be permitted in the
House. This rule does not apply to whiskey, gin,
brandy, and the French liqueurs.</p>

<h2>PRESIDENT PAT</h2>

<p>(<i>From the forthcoming History of Parliament</i>)</p>

<p>One blow and Ireland sprang from the head of
her Saxon enslaver a new Minerva! Proudly and
solemnly she then sat down to frame a Republic
worthy of Plato and Pat. Her first president had
been a workhouse porter and a night watchman.
He was, therefore, eminently fitted both for civil
and military administration. The speech of President
Pat on opening Congress develops his policy
and his well-digested plans of legislative reform.
Here are a few choice quotations:&mdash;</p>

<p>The key-stone of Government is the blarney
stone.</p>

<p>Political progress may always be accelerated by
a bludgeon.</p>

<p>Our institutions must be consolidated by soft
soap and whacks.</p>

<p>The people's will is made known by manifesto,
and by many fists too.
</p>

<p>Every man shall be qualified to sit in Congress
that is a 10 lb. pig-holder, provided that the pig
and the member sleep under the same roof.</p>

<p>Members of Congress will be remunerated for
their public services. Gentlemen wearing gloves
only to have the privilege of shaking the president's
hand. The unwashed to be paid at the door.</p>

<p>Pipes will not be allowed on the Opposition
benches, nor may any member take whiskey until
challenged by the president.</p>

<p>Under no circumstances will a member be
suffered to sit with his blunderbuss at full-cock,
nor pointed at the president's ear.</p>

<p>Our ambassadors will be chosen from our most
meritorious postmen, so that they may have no
difficulty in reading their letters.</p>

<p>The Foreign Office will be presided over by a
patriotic editor who has travelled in New South
Wales and is thoroughly conversant with its
language.</p>

<p>Instead of bulwarks, the island will be fortified
by Irish bulls; our military engineers being of
opinion that no other horn-works are so efficient
or necessary.</p>

<h2>HOW TO MAKE AN IRISH
STORY</h2>

<p>Lay your scene principally in Galway, and let
your chief characters be the officers of a regiment
of Dragoons. Represent them as habitual
drunkards, as duellists, and as practical jokers; but
take care to exclude from their tricks everything like
wit. Introduce as frequently as possible, with the
necessary variation only of time, place, and circumstance,
a tipsy brawl, with a table oversetting in
the midst of it, and a ragamuffin with a great stick
in his hand, capering thereon. Do not omit to
mention the bottles and glasses that whistle, during
this performance, about his ears, nor the chairs
and fire-irons which are used by the surrounding
combatants; and under the table fail not to place
your comic character; for instance, your priest.
Upset mail coaches, and make horses run away
with their riders continually: and be careful, having
bribed some clever artist to prostitute his talents,
to have all these intellectually humorous scenes
illustrated, in that your readers may fully appreciate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>the only jokes they are likely to understand. Put
"an affair of honour" into about every other
chapter; and for the credit and renown of your
country, you being an Irishman, exhibit it as
conducted with the most insensate levity. Indeed,
in furtherance of this object, depict your countrymen
in general as a set of irrational, unfeeling, crazy
blockheads; only, not having sense enough to be
selfish, as lavish and prodigal in the extreme.
Never mind your plot, but string adventure upon
adventure, without sequence or connexion; just
remembering to wind up with a marriage. For
example, your hero may shoot some old gentleman
through the head&mdash;or hat&mdash;and run away with
his niece, an heiress. Whenever you are at a loss
for fun&mdash;that is, when you find it impracticable to
tumble or knock one another down&mdash;throw yourself
on your brogue, and introduce&mdash;"Arrah!
now, honey, be aisy." "Long life to yer honour,
sure, and didn't I?" "Is it praties, ye mane?"
"Sorrow a bit." "<i>Musha!</i>" "<i>Mavourneen!</i>" and
the like phrases (having the interjectional ones
printed in italics, that their point may be the more
obvious), which you will find excellent substitutes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>for wit. Your tale, thus prepared, take it to some
publisher, and let him serve it up monthly to the
unintelligent portion of the public with puff sauce.</p>

<h2>EXTRACTS FROM THE IRISH
HUE AND CRY</h2>

<p>Tony Gowan is advertised of having lost "a
pig with a very long tail, and a black spot on the
tip of its snout that curls up behind."</p>

<p>A cow is described as "very difficult to milk,
and of no use to anyone but the owner, with one
horn much longer than the other."</p>

<p>John Hawkins is alluded to as having "a pair
of quick grey eyes, with little or no whiskers, and a
Roman nose, that has a great difficulty in looking
any one in the face."</p>

<p>Betsy Waterton is accused of having "absconded
with a chest of drawers and a cock and hen, and
has red hair and a broken tooth, none of which are
her own."</p>

<p>The manager of the savings' bank at Dunferry,
near Goofowran, is spoken of in these terms: "He
had on, when last seen, a pair of corduroy trousers
with a tremendous squint rather the worse for
wear, besides an affected lisp, which he endeavours
to conceal with a pair of gold spectacles."</p>

<h2>PUNCH'S FOLK-LORE</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">St. Patrick's Day</span></p>

<p>The season of spring gives us lamb and violets,
salmon and patron saints. St. David and St.
Patrick are commemorated in March, St. George
only waits until April. (Of this last-named saint
a very careful notice has for some time been in preparation,
to include six autobiographical anecdotes
of his boyish days, a selection from his unpublished
correspondence with his laundress, and an authentic
portrait of his chief antagonist&mdash;the Dragon.)</p>

</div>

<p>St. Patrick's Day! the heart leaps up with
uncontrolled delight, and a flood of popular airs
comes rushing o'er the brain. What reminiscences
of by-gone days invade the territory of the mind!
All the population of Dublin, headed by the Lord-Lieutenant
and Ulster King-at-Arms, abroad at
daybreak, looking for four-leaved shamrocks in the
Ph&oelig;nix Park, and singing Moore's <i>Melodies</i> in
unison; an agreeable mixture of whiskey and
water provided in unlimited quantities in every
market town in Ireland, the expense of the water<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a><br /><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
being defrayed out of the Consolidated Fund; the
Lord Mayor of Dublin presented with a new
shillelagh of polished oak, bound with brass, purchased
by the united contributions of every
grown-up citizen bearing the name of Patrick;
the constabulary in new boots; a public dinner on
the Blarney Stone, and a fancy-dress ball on the
Wicklow Mountains! These are but a few of the
marks of distinction showered on this memorable
day by Erin's grateful sons and daughters, who owe
to St. Patrick two of the greatest distinctions that
ever befell them&mdash;freedom from serpents, snakes,
scorpions, efts, newts, tadpoles, chameleons, salamanders,
daddy-long-legs, and all other venomous
reptiles, and instruction in six lessons, in "the
true art of mixing their liquor, an art," it has
been well observed, "which has never since been
lost."</p>

<p>This leaning of the Saint to potheen is viewed,
however, by one section of the community with
manifest displeasure&mdash;the Temperance and Teetotal
Societies&mdash;who remain indoors the whole of the day
with the blinds closely drawn down and straw in
front of their houses, and employ paid emissaries
to distribute tracts amongst their excitable countrymen.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span></p>

<p>The notorious fact that St. Patrick lived to be
considerably more than a hundred, cut a wisdom
tooth at ninety-eight, never had a day's illness in
his life, was possessed of funded property, and
could see to read without spectacles until within
six weeks of his untimely end (caused by a fall
from a cherry tree), speaks libraries for the tonic
and salubrious qualities of that stimulating spirit,
which has ever since his day been known and
highly appreciated under the name of "L.L.," or
Long Livers' Whiskey.</p>

<p>A curious custom is kept up by the Knights of
the Order of St. Patrick (founded by King Brian
Boroo the Fourteenth) on the morning of this day,
the origin of which is lost among the wilds of
Connemara. Before it is light the Knights all go
up in their robes and shamrocks, one by one, into
the belfry of the Cathedral, and toll the great bell
one hundred and twenty-three times, the exact
number of years to which the Saint, in forgetfulness
of Sir George Cornwall Lewis and the Editor
of <i>Notes and Queries</i>, is said to have attained.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a><br /><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
They then parade the principal streets of Dublin
on piebald horses, preceded by a band of music
and the Law Officers of the Crown, and disperse
at a moment's notice, no one knows where.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>St. Patrick's tastes were athletic. He had a
wart on his forehead, and a cousin in the militia;
and displayed a profound acquaintance with the
laws of short whist, then in its infancy. He was
an early riser, a deep thinker, and a careless
dresser, and foresaw, with an eagle glance, the
gradual development of the railway system, while
his declining years were soothed by the devoted
attentions of some of the oldest families in Ireland.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">New Bulls</span> <i>v.</i> <span class="smcap">Old Cows</span>.&mdash;At the Thames
Police Court Mr. Benson condemned the owner
and vendor of a quantity of old Irish cow beef to
penalties for selling meat unfit for human consumption.
This should be a warning to all whom it may
concern, that though new Irish bulls may be introduced
freely, and even be relished in this country,
there is no toleration for old Irish cows on this side
St. George's Channel.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Royal Visit to Ireland</span></p>

<p>No doubt some of our readers have been, at one
time or another, in Ireland, especially those who were
born there. It is hoped, however, that the following
notes may be of some value to those whose attention
has now for the first time been attracted to
this country by the King's visit.</p>

<p>Many, however, will remember that not very
long ago Ireland was the scene of perhaps the
most bloodless and humane motor-car encounters
of modern times.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of the island (who consist of men,
women, and children of both sexes) are full of native
character. They are generally fond of animals, especially
pigs and "bulls." These latter wear what
is known as a Celtic fringe on the forehead.</p>

<p>The principal exports are emigrants, M.P.s,
shamrocks, Dublin Fusiliers, Field Marshals, real
lace, and cigars.</p>

<p>A full list of "Previous Royal Visits to Ireland
and other Countries" will be found in another
column of some other paper.</p>

pronounced very much like the English word
"doubling," with the final "g" omitted.</p>

<p>The tourist will find the language difficulty comparatively
easy, as English is now spoken in most of
the large shops.</p>

<p>A few phrases, such as "Erin go bragh," "Begorra ye spalpeen,"
"Acushla mavourneen," &amp;c., are easily learnt, and the trouble
involved is amply repaid in the simple joy of the natives on hearing a
foreigner speak their own language.</p>

<p>English gold is accepted in Ireland,
and the rate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
of exchange works out at twenty shillings to the
sovereign. Two sixpences will always be accepted
in lieu of a shilling.</p>

<p>N.B.&mdash;To avoid disappointment to naturalists
and others we think it right to mention that since
the late raid of St. Patrick there are no snakes of
first-rate quality in Ireland.</p>
